# S_Akash_LangGraph_2410110034
Repo for my learnings from the LangGraph course as part of MAT496.

## Module 1: Video 1 (Motivation)
- Learnt about the control flow of Langgraph applications. Control flow can either be manual or created by the LLM itself. The more autonomy you give to the LLM, the less reliable it becomes, and Langgraph tries to bridge that gap. 
- No code executed in this video.
